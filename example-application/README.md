In this application I will be performing aggregations on 100 integers.
Criteria:

    1. Add 100 random integers, ranging from 0 to 100, to a new database called newnum.db.
    2. Prompt the user whether they would like to perform an aggregation (AVG, MAX, MIN, or SUM) or exit the program altogether. Break this assignment into two scripts. Name them sql-insert.py and sql-search.py.
